Scrum Master Report

What went well?

* I believe I assigned the tasks fairly to everyone. We had to set up a simple login system.
  I realised it was a trivial feature so I decided to assign it to all the teams to collaborate and create their own login system.
  This, immensely helped us understand the dynamic of our group, people's strengths and weaknesses.
  We now know what type of tasks we should assign to each member.

* We managed to finish all our user stories as we managed to implement all the features corresponding to the user stories.
  We successfully implemented a login screen, sign up screen and a menu with mock features. Our user stories were accepted,  but
  our client wanted better validation for our login and registration page so we moved the user stories for login and sign up features
  to Sprint 2. And worked on it immediately to fix our imperfections and push the changes the day after our client meeting.

What duties did you perform well as a Scrum Master?

* I believe I properly conducted the stand up meetings with my group and kept track of the meeting in an attendance sheet.
* I also created the issues for all 3 user stories we agreed to do with our client.
  I made sure to assign weights and assign it to members who did not assign themselves to the user stories.
* I made sure to record a professional demo with my team at the end of the sprint to send it to the client for final feedback at the end of the sprint.


What duties could you have performed better?

* I wish I helped my team start working on the app as soon as the sprint started. There were a couple days where much work wasn't done.
  If we made use of that time we could have finished the complete validation of the login system and sign up pages within the time limit of the sprint.
* I wish I checked up on the non active members a lot more. About 2 members were inactive for most of the sprint.
  I wish I kept reaching out to them often so I knew what work they were doing and provide them help with doing the user stories.
* I wish I shared wireframes for our screens with other members.
  This helps in preventing multiple different mental models of the app in the team. Everyone knows whats the most important features to implement.
