Good day 

I recently noticed my results for checkpoint one but there was no feedback.

I would like to know if there has been an error or this was on purpose.

Also after comparing my results to my fellow group mates, I notices that mine was lower than that, I put so much effort into the group work and would like to know if there was a particular reason for me getting a lower grade?

Regards 
Femi Osibemekun

Hi Femi,

The feedback is contained within the built-in rubric attached to the assessment. Do you have the option when looking at marks to open the rubric?

And some marks have been reduced (or capped) based on the peer-assessment ratings submitted (and checked with the history of gitlab commits). I'm happy to discuss this more if you wish. 

Kind regards,
James

Hi Femi,

OK sure. How is 10:00am tomorrow morning? Would you like to meet virtually (Teams) or f2f? 

And that is strange - is there any option to select to "show feedback" on the rubric (I know that when entering it, I have to explicitly choose "show feedback" for the boxes to be displayed).

Virtually on teams would be better.
I clicked show feedback and it doesnâ€™t show anything more

Hi Femi,

Thanks for bringing this to my attention. As you spoke about in the meeting - there are commits made by you in Sprint 1. I have therefore removed the reduction of your mark - does the feedback now show? Just a few comments to remember for the future:
Avoid making lots of commits on the day of the meeting - this does not give evidence of working consistently throughout the sprint
Some commits you made have a full file appearing - all such files could have been pushed as a single commit - you should create the file early one, and then make changes to it (with real time commits across the sprint). This would demonstrate consistent progress being made. 
Are you the committer "ruHostile"? If not, do you know who is?
Kind regards,
James

Hi James

Hi Femi,

Great, thanks. Sorry for the confusion this caused. 

If you can keep a record of this in the readme file (on the main branch) that would be great. 

Kind regards,
James


Femi
No problem. Will do.
