## Source code for Sprint 2
Our collective work can be found in the main branch by navigating to files/AndroidDevelopment. All the files inside that directory are directly related to our program. The program can be run using Andriod Studio, by opening the AndroidDevelopment folder within the Andriod Studio and running 'app' in the project explorer.

## Installation instructions for Sprint 2.

For Sprint 2, we have worked on the Add Patient and View Patients features, to see them follow the steps below: 

PREREQUISITES:
* AndroidStudio (Latest) and an Android Device emulator (can be downloaded from the device manager inside the IDE) or a physical Android device.
* Connection to firebase authentication: Go tools>firebase>authentication>authenticate using a custom authentication system>Follow the steps provided (At least 1 and 2).
* Connection to firebase realtime database: Go tools>firebase>realtime database>get started with realtime database>Follow the steps provided (At least 1 and 2).

1. Go to the files directory in the main branch
2. Copy the AndroidDevelopment folder to your local machine and use AndroidStudio to Open the project.
3. All configurations are exported to Git so nothing should be changed.
4. On the left of the Android Studio, look at the project structure and right-click on "app" and click Run.
5. You should see a login page, Use these credentials - U: testuser@le.ac.uk and P: test1234
6. If you are connected to the internet then you should successfully login and be redirected to the Dashboard.
7. TO ADD A PATIENT FOLLOW STEPS (7-9): Press "Add patient" and fill the entire form of 4 screens.
8. Once, you submit the details and add patient to database (with an internet connection), you can view those details in "View patients".

9. TO VIEW ALL PATIENTS FOLLOW THESE STEP 9: Press "View Patients" to go to a screen with many patients' details, scroll down to find your newly added patient information!


IMPORTANT: If you see the option to Run tests (when you click on "app"), then look at the top bar of the IDE to find a hammer icon. Just to the right of it is a configurations editor where you click and choose "app". Then click the triangular green run button. This should run the program and a login page should appear.
